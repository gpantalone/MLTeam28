## Movie Profit Analysis

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gpantalone/MLTeam28/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

A machine learning analysis of what factors affect movie profitability. We wanted to see if it was possible to accurately predict the success of a movie release based on available information about the production. We also wanted to see if it was possible to determine the level of impact that certain factors have on success. For example do good stars tend to produce successful movies more than good directors or writers? Are certain combinations of factors more impactful together than they are in isolation?

### Data Visualization

To find a way to appropriately analyze data from the set we started with some histograms to help us look at how much info we felt we could glean from different features.
